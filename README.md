## Principle Component Analysis : Dimension_Reduction

Everyon knows on thing is that in order to work in machine learning, the amount of dataset required to be more but have you ever asked yourself if there is a problem if the number of features in the dataset becomes more?
To put it more simply, this redundant feature makes it very difficult to extract insights from datasets from exploratory data analysis.
and at the same time, such datasets use a lot of competitive resource.

This article will be discussed about principle Component Analysis and dimension reduction which will be especially helpful when working with large datasets in machinelearning.
