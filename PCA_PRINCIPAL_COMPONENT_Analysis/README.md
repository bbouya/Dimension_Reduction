# Dimension_Reduction

## PCA 

As I have already discussed above that when the size of dataset will be larger then 
various redundant features can be found that usually constitue a plathera of dilemmas,
So in order to overcome these problems. the dimension of dataset is reduced and it is called 
Principal Component Analysis or PCA, Let's move on to see the steps of PCA.

The PCA usually consists of som significant steps that are shown in bellow :
	STEP 1: Scalise dataset : Scaling is a method of equating dataset. As result, the dataset is relatively unbiased.
	
		remarque : (BIAS : is a dispropotionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing. usually in a way that is closed-minded,
					prejudicial, or unfaire. Biases can be innate or learned People may develop biases for or against an individual, a group, or a belief.)
